# Bitcoin Header Proof

In this task, you should use [RISC Zeroâ€™s zkVM](https://github.com/risc0/risc0)
to write a program that could be used to convince someone that you are in
possession of a valid Bitcoin block header. The constituents of the block header
(except for the nonce) should be written to the journal. The proof should reveal
nothing about the nonce, other than the fact that it produces a valid block
meeting the specified difficulty and that you know its value. One might use such
a gadget to convince a mining pool to give you some money up front before
delivering the header.

## CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into
production - then push your changes to the main branch.

Have fun coding! ðŸš€

## Background

At RISC Zero, we believe that technical screens should be optimized for
real-world coding skills and candidate pool inclusivity. We believe that a
take-home coding exercise is the best way to do that.

## Effort

We recognize that candidates are often applying for multiple positions, so we
try to keep our exercises from being too onerous. Itâ€™s impossible for us to keep
all exercises the exact same difficulty, but candidates should expect to put two
to four hours into a project. Depending on the exercise, the weighting of this
time between research and coding may differ.

## Grading

We put a lot of effort into making sure that submissions are graded
consistently. Though we typically canâ€™t provide detailed feedback, weâ€™re looking
for code that is functional, usable, efficient, maintainable, and secure. Beyond
that, weâ€™re looking for a demonstration of skills that apply to the specific
role that youâ€™re applying to. We donâ€™t expect submissions to be flawless - real
world coding requires compromises, and so should your submission. As part of
final interviews, we ask candidates to talk more deeply about their take-home
submission - this is a great time to talk about where you had to compromise.

## Questions

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to your contact at RISC Zero.
Though this is expected to be mostly a solo exercise, it is possible that there
are ambiguities or issues with prompts. If there are, weâ€™d like to know about
them both to make your experience better and to improve the experience for
future candidates.
